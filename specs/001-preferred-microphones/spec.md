# Feature Specification: Preferred Microphones Fallback

**Feature Branch**: `001-preferred-microphones`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "In my project currently I can set the default microphone that is being used. However, I sometimes have multiple microphones that I plug in and plug out. So I want to add a new feature in the configuration of the project, or the configuration of the app, such that I can have a list of preferred microphones. And then, for example, it would be like an array with the name of the microphones. If the first one is available, then use it, and if not, then fold back the second option, et cetera, et cetera. This preference is optional. If the array is empty, then default to the default microphone, I guess."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automatic Microphone Selection from Preferences (Priority: P1)

As a user who frequently switches between multiple microphones (e.g., built-in, USB, Bluetooth), I want the application to automatically select my preferred available microphone so that I don't have to manually reconfigure the audio input each time I connect or disconnect devices.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the feature. Users with multiple microphones experience friction when devices are plugged/unplugged, and automatic fallback eliminates manual intervention.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring a preference list, plugging/unplugging microphones in different orders, and verifying the application selects the highest-priority available device. Delivers immediate value by reducing user configuration time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have configured preferred microphones as ["Studio Mic", "USB Headset", "Built-in"], **When** I start the application with "Studio Mic" connected, **Then** the application uses "Studio Mic" as the active input device
2. **Given** I have configured preferred microphones as ["Studio Mic", "USB Headset", "Built-in"], **When** "Studio Mic" is not available but "USB Headset" is connected, **Then** the application uses "USB Headset" as the active input device
3. **Given** I have configured preferred microphones as ["Studio Mic", "USB Headset", "Built-in"], **When** none of the preferred microphones are available, **Then** the application uses "Built-in" as the active input device
4. **Given** I have configured preferred microphones as ["Studio Mic", "USB Headset"], **When** I connect "Studio Mic" while the application is using "USB Headset", **Then** the application switches to "Studio Mic" automatically

### User Story 2 - Configure Preferred Microphone List (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to view and edit my list of preferred microphones in the application configuration so that I can control which devices take priority and in what order.

**Why this priority**: Configuration capability is essential for the feature to function. Without the ability to set preferences, the automatic selection cannot work. This is a foundational requirement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by opening the configuration interface, adding/removing/reordering microphone preferences, saving, and verifying the changes persist. Delivers value by giving users control over device priority.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open the application configuration, **When** I view the microphone preferences section, **Then** I see a list of my currently configured preferred microphones (or an empty list if none configured)
2. **Given** I am viewing the microphone preferences list, **When** I add a new microphone name to the list, **Then** the microphone is saved to my preferences
3. **Given** I have multiple microphones in my preferences, **When** I reorder the list, **Then** the new order is saved and reflects the priority for device selection
4. **Given** I have microphones in my preferences, **When** I remove a microphone from the list, **Then** it is no longer considered for automatic selection
5. **Given** I have an empty preferences list, **When** I save the configuration, **Then** the application defaults to system default microphone behavior

### User Story 3 - View Current Active Microphone and Selection Status (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see which microphone is currently active and whether it was selected from my preferences or is a fallback, so that I can verify the application is using the correct input device.

**Why this priority**: Visibility into the current state helps users troubleshoot issues and builds trust that the preference system is working. This is important for user confidence but not essential for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by connecting different microphones and observing the status display in the application UI. Delivers value by providing transparency and reducing user confusion about which device is being used.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application has selected "Studio Mic" from my preferences, **When** I view the audio settings or status display, **Then** I see "Studio Mic" indicated as the active device
2. **Given** my preferred microphone is unavailable and the application selected a fallback, **When** I view the audio settings, **Then** I see an indication that a fallback device is in use
3. **Given** I have no configured preferences, **When** I view the audio settings, **Then** I see the system default microphone is in use

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a preferred microphone name in the configuration doesn't match any available device exactly (e.g., due to OS naming differences or typos)?
- How does the system handle duplicate entries in the preferred microphones list?
- What happens when a microphone becomes unavailable mid-recording/transcription?
- How does the system behave if all preferred microphones become unavailable simultaneously?
- What happens when multiple devices have similar names (e.g., "USB Audio Device" appears twice)?
- How does the application handle rapid connect/disconnect events (device flickering)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to configure an ordered list of preferred microphone names in the application configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist the preferred microphones list across application restarts
- **FR-003**: System MUST iterate through the preferred microphones list in order and select the first available device that matches by name
- **FR-004**: System MUST fall back to the system default microphone when the preferred list is empty or no preferred microphones are available
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect when a higher-priority preferred microphone becomes available and switch to it automatically
- **FR-006**: System MUST perform case-insensitive matching when comparing configured microphone names to available device names
- **FR-007**: System MUST use exact string matching (case-insensitive only) when comparing configured microphone names to available device names - users must enter the complete device name as it appears in the system
- **FR-008**: System MUST display the currently active microphone name to the user
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to add, remove, and reorder microphones in the preferences list
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that the preferences list contains only valid text entries (no empty strings)
- **FR-011**: System MUST continue using the current microphone if it remains available, even if it's not in the preferences list

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Preferred Microphone Configuration**: An ordered list of microphone device names representing user preferences. Stored persistently in application configuration. Each entry is a string representing the device name as it appears in the system.
- **Active Microphone Status**: The currently selected and in-use audio input device, including metadata about whether it was selected from preferences or as a fallback.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can configure their preferred microphones list in under 1 minute
- **SC-002**: When a preferred microphone is connected, the application selects it within 2 seconds without user intervention
- **SC-003**: The application correctly selects the highest-priority available microphone from the preferences list in 100% of test scenarios
- **SC-004**: Users with multiple microphones report reduced manual configuration time by at least 80%
- **SC-005**: The application successfully persists and restores the preferences list across 100% of application restarts

## Assumptions

1. Microphone device names are consistent for the same physical device across application sessions (OS-dependent behavior)
2. Users know the names of their microphone devices or can discover them through system settings
3. The application already has infrastructure for reading and writing configuration files
4. The application has existing capability to enumerate available audio input devices from the system
5. Automatic device switching mid-session is desirable and won't cause user confusion (if this is problematic, switching could be limited to application startup only)
6. Case-insensitive matching is sufficient for most use cases without requiring sophisticated fuzzy matching
