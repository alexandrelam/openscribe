# Specification Quality Checklist: Preferred Microphones Fallback

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks completed successfully

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-19

**Summary**:
- All mandatory sections are complete and well-structured
- No implementation details present - specification remains technology-agnostic
- All functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- User scenarios cover primary flows with detailed acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases comprehensively identified
- One clarification was resolved: microphone name matching strategy (exact match, case-insensitive)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.implement`

## Notes
