# Voice-to-Text Desktop Application - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
A lightweight desktop application that enables users to quickly convert speech to text and insert it directly into any focused input field across the system. The app uses faster-whisper for offline, privacy-focused speech recognition.

## Objectives
- **Primary**: Provide seamless voice-to-text functionality that works system-wide
- **Secondary**: Maintain user privacy through local processing (no cloud dependencies)
- **Tertiary**: Offer a simple, intuitive user experience with minimal setup

## Core Features

### MVP Features
1. **Global Hotkey/Button**: Press to start/stop recording
2. **Voice Recording**: Capture audio from system microphone
3. **Speech Transcription**: Convert audio to text using faster-whisper
4. **Text Insertion**: Automatically insert transcribed text into focused input field
5. **Visual Feedback**: Show recording status and processing state

### Enhanced Features (Future)
- Custom hotkey configuration
- Multiple language support
- Punctuation and formatting options
- Audio playback for verification
- Transcription history/clipboard integration

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.13**: Main application language
- **faster-whisper**: Speech recognition engine (using Whisper Small model)
- **GUI Framework**: tkinter (built-in) or PyQt/tkinter for cross-platform compatibility
- **Audio Recording**: pyaudio or sounddevice
- **System Integration**: pyautogui or pynput for text insertion

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum (faster-whisper model loading)
- **Storage**: ~500MB for Whisper Small model
- **Microphone**: Required for audio input
- **Permissions**: Microphone access, accessibility permissions for text insertion

## User Experience Flow

### Primary Workflow
1. User positions cursor in any text input field
2. User clicks record button or presses hotkey
3. App shows recording indicator
4. User speaks into microphone
5. User clicks stop or presses hotkey again
6. App processes audio with faster-whisper
7. Transcribed text appears in the focused input field

### Error Scenarios
- No microphone detected → Show error message with setup instructions
- No input field focused → Show warning or paste to clipboard
- Transcription fails → Offer retry option or show error details
- Permissions denied → Guide user through permission setup

## Technical Architecture

### Application Components
1. **GUI Layer**: Minimal interface with record button and status indicator
2. **Audio Manager**: Handle microphone input and recording
3. **Transcription Engine**: Interface with faster-whisper
4. **System Integration**: Detect focus and insert text
5. **Configuration**: Store user preferences and model settings

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Audio Recording → Whisper Processing → Text Output → System Insertion
```

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- **Transcription Accuracy**: >90% for clear speech
- **Processing Time**: <5 seconds for 30-second audio clips
- **System Integration**: Works across major applications (browsers, text editors, messaging apps)
- **Resource Usage**: <500MB RAM during operation

### User Experience Goals
- **Setup Time**: <5 minutes from download to first use
- **Learning Curve**: Intuitive enough for non-technical users
- **Reliability**: 95% success rate for typical usage scenarios

## Privacy & Security
- **Local Processing**: All transcription happens offline
- **No Data Collection**: No audio or text data transmitted externally
- **Temporary Storage**: Audio files deleted immediately after processing
- **User Control**: Clear indicators when microphone is active

## Constraints & Limitations
- **Model Size**: Using Whisper Small model for optimal balance of speed and accuracy
- **System Permissions**: May require elevated permissions for global text insertion
- **Language Support**: Initially English-only, expandable to other languages
- **Real-time Processing**: Not real-time due to faster-whisper architecture

## Future Considerations
- Mobile companion app
- Integration with popular productivity tools
- Custom vocabulary/domain-specific models
- Multi-speaker recognition
- Cloud sync for settings (opt-in)
